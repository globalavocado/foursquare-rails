# foursquare with rails

this app will let a user search for their nearest coffee shop and display the results in a list, as well as on a map.

## user stories

- as a user, I want to be able to enter a UK location name, so that I can find out which coffee shops are near me
- as a user, i want to see a list of coffee shops so that I can choose one from its name
- as a user, I want to be able to sort the coffee shops, so that I can see the most popular one at the top 
- as a user, I want to see a map with pins so that I know where the coffee shops are
- as a user, I want to see an error message so that I know whether something went wrong

nice-to-have:

- as a user, I want to be able to see suggestions for other neighbourhoods in case of no results, so that I can get to the nearest coffee as quickly as possible 
- as a user, I want to be able to enter a UK post code, so that I can find out which coffee shops are near me

## minimal acceptance criteria:

* a search box to enter a place name 
* list of coffee shops with basic details
